# Emoji Explorer

Welcome to Emoji Explorer, a fun and interactive game built with React. This game is currently hosted on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://emoji-explorer.vercel.app).

## Description

Emoji Explorer is a game where players interact with various emojis in a dynamic game environment. The game is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The game's logic is handled by a series of helper functions, and the game's state is managed using React's built-in state management capabilities.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Usage

Once you've started the game, you'll be presented with a series of emojis. You need to collect 3 same emojis and put them into the basket. 3 same emojis in the basket will trade into 100 score. Notice that the upper limit of the number of emojis it can hold is 7, meaning that if you can't find the same 3 emojis within 7 actions, you lost the game. 
The mechanic of the game is still waiting for future improvement. 
For now, you can only interact with these emojis according to the game's rules. As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases, providing a fun and challenging experience.
